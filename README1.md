### Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is the submission for Mundy Jim  for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

### Dataset: 
**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones**

### Files
_codebook1.md_ is the code book that describes in detail, the variables, the data, and any other  transformations that I performed to tidy up the dataset

### run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and is followed by the 5 steps required in the course project’s definition:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. *
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.**
